    Backend: Django with Django REST framework for building RESTful APIs. Django provides a lot of built-in functionality for building web applications and has great documentation. The Django REST framework provides powerful and flexible tools for building APIs.

    Database: PostgreSQL, a powerful and reliable open-source relational database management system. PostgreSQL has great support for large-scale applications and provides advanced features such as transactions, concurrency control, and data integrity.

    Frontend: Vue.js, a progressive and lightweight JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue.js provides a lot of flexibility and modularity and is easy to learn and use.

    Mobile app: Flutter, a fast and modern mobile app development framework from Google. Flutter allows for rapid development and provides a rich set of customizable widgets and tools.

    Authentication and Authorization: Django's built-in authentication system with JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication for securing APIs. JWT authentication is stateless, scalable, and secure.

    Messaging: Django Channels, a library that extends Django to handle WebSockets and asynchronous tasks. Channels makes it easy to add real-time functionality to your application.

    Hosting: Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure for reliable and scalable hosting. Both services provide a wide range of tools and services for hosting and managing web applications.

    Version Control: Git with a hosted Git repository like GitHub or GitLab for version control and collaboration.

    Testing: Automated testing with pytest for backend APIs, and Jest for frontend unit testing. Testing ensures that the application is stable and secure.

    Security: OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) guidelines for ensuring the application is secure against common web application security threats.

    Development Environment: Docker for containerization and consistent development environment setup across developers.

    Continuous Integration and Deployment: Use a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deploying code changes to the staging and production environments. Tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, or Travis CI can be used for this purpose.
